## <img src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/latest/1f4a1/512.gif" alt="üí°" width="20" height="20"> Overview

This repository is for my homelab infrastructure & Kubernetes clusters. I do the best I can to adhere to IaC (Infrastructure as Code) and GitOps best practices using tools like [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

This semi hyper-converged cluster operates on [Talos Linux](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos), an immutable and ephemeral Linux distribution tailored for [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes), and is deployed on bare-metal [MS-A2](https://store.minisforum.com/products/minisforum-ms-a2) workstations. [Rook](https://github.com/rook/rook) supplies my workloads with persistent block, object, and file storage, while a separate server handles media file storage & long term object storage backups. The cluster is designed to enable a full teardown without any data loss.

There is a template at [onedr0p/cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template) if you want to follow along with some of the practices I use here.

### Core Components

- [actions-runner-controller](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller) - Self-hosted GitHub runners
- [cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager) - Creates SSL certificates for services in my cluster
- [cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium) - eBPF-based networking for my workloads
- [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared) - Enables Cloudflare secure access to my routes
- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) - Automatically syncs ingress DNS records to a DNS provider
- [multus](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni) - Multi-homed pod networking
- [rook](https://github.com/rook/rook) - Distributed block storage for persistent storage
- [spegel](https://github.com/spegel-org/spegel) - Stateless cluster local OCI registry mirror
- [volsync](https://github.com/backube/volsync) - Backup and recovery of persistent volume claims

### GitOps

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches my [kubernetes](./kubernetes) folder (see Directories below) and makes the changes to my clusters based on the state of my Git repository.

Flux will recursively search the [kubernetes/apps](./kubernetes/apps) folder until it finds the most top level `kustomization.yaml` per directory and then apply all the resources listed in it. That aforementioned `kustomization.yaml` will generally only have a namespace resource and one or many Flux kustomizations (`ks.yaml`). Under the control of those Flux kustomizations there will be a `HelmRelease` or other resources related to the application which will be applied.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) monitors my **entire** repository for dependency updates, automatically creating a PR when updates are found. When a PR is merged Flux will automatically apply the changes to my cluster.

### Directories

This Git repository contains the following directories under [kubernetes](./kubernetes).

```sh
üìÅ kubernetes      # Kubernetes cluster defined as code
‚îú‚îÄüìÅ apps          # Apps deployed into my cluster grouped by namespace (see below)
‚îú‚îÄüìÅ components    # Re-usable kustomize components
‚îî‚îÄüìÅ flux          # Flux system configuration
```
